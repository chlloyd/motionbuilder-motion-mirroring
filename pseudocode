## Basic Pseudocode for the project


# UI decision to for the orientation the motion capture wants to be flip to

START

Initial UI
change_orientation = UI tickbox


FOR frames in frame sequence:
    for rotation in joint:
        flip from hip joint (change_orientation, rotation)
        END FOR
    END FOR


FUNC flip from hip joint (orientation, rotation):
    convert quaternion to rotation matrix
    mirror matrix on orientation
    convert rotation matrix to quaternion
    return new quaternion
    END FUNC


END
